  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>Love You A Latte</p>
  <p>We are the oldest coffee house in the city of Columbus State. We started in Leipzig, Germany.<br>
    Our first cup was poured in Europe in 1711 and it has not stopped since.<br>
    The NEICE of the owner came to America in 1816. she settled in Ohio and opened up Love you a latte.</p>

<p>We use the original recipes from the original coffee house in Germany with a twist of brews that are popular today.<br>
  There is no better tasting coffee than our brew. nobody can say that they started their first brew in 1711.<br> 
  Our coffee is imported from Germany. you cannot have this unique and wonderful tasting coffee any elsewhere in the U.S. It is pure love with a little latte.
